#Explanation:
#Objective Function: profit_coeffs represents the coefficients for the profit (420, 360, and 300) for large, medium, and small units at the three plants.

#Constraints: constraint_matrix contains the coefficients for the constraints:

#First 3 rows represent production capacity constraints for the three plants.
#Next 3 rows represent storage constraints.
#Last 3 rows represent sales demand constraints.
#Right-Hand Side (rhs): This represents the upper bounds of production capacity, storage, and demand.

#Constraint Directions: All constraints are less than or equal to (<=).

#Solve: The lp function solves the linear program. The solution gives the optimal production plan and the maximum profit.

#Output:
#solution gives the number of units of each size (large, medium, small) to produce at each plant.
